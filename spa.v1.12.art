Law of the Jungle|[1]|'Now this is the Law of the Jungle - as old and as true as the sky; And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the Wolf that shall break it must die. As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk the Law runneth forward and back for the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.' - Rudyard Kipling.
