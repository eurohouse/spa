Leaving Neverland|[1]|A documentary on Michael Jackson that debuted Sunday night on HBO features accusations from two men who claim the late pop icon sexually assaulted them when they were children. "Leaving Neverland" tells the stories of James Safechuck and Wade Robson, who allege the legendary singer sexually abused them separately. The first part of the four-hour documentary aired Sunday night. Part two aired Monday night. All four hours are available for streaming on HBO Now and HBO Go. In the documentary, Safechuck, now 37, said he first met Jackson while filming a Pepsi commercial around the time of his 9th birthday. Robson, now 41, said he met the singer after winning a dance contest when he was 5 years old. The men allege Jackson sexually abused them at his Neverland ranch after developing friendships with each. On Tuesday, director Dan Reed told "CBS This Morning" the film is not "about Michael Jackson.": "It's a film about Wade Robson and James Safechuck, two little boys to whom this dreadful thing happened long ago. It's the story of their coming to terms with that over two decades and the story of their families," Reed said. "As far as including other eyewitnesses to that, there was no one else in the room, I don't believe, when Wade was being molested by Michael or when James was having sex with Michael." The filmmakers did not seek comment from the Jackson family nor his estate, which is now suing HBO for $100 million, claiming HBO is in breach of contract for disparaging Jackson in the film. The network has said it will move forward with airing "Leaving Neverland" as planned. Michael Jackson died in 2009, leaving members of his family to defend him and his legacy as new allegations thrust the late singer and his family back into the spotlight.
