The Original Airhead|[1]|The original airhead: Talentless, lazy and self-absorbed. How screen goddess Marilyn Monroe was the model for today's breed of vapid C-listers. She was the ultimate screen goddess, the biggest sex symbol ever to come out of Hollywood. And almost 50 years after her death, Marilyn Monroe remains an unrivalled cultural icon, an object of desire for millions of men and an inspiration for successive generations of women. The obsession with her will be further fuelled in Britain this month with the release of the high-profile movie, My Week With Marilyn. Starring the brilliant young Hollywood actress Michelle Williams in the title role, the film covers the period in 1957 when Monroe was in England to make the Prince And The Showgirl, playing opposite Laurence Olivier. At the time, Monroe was still in her somewhat incongruous marriage to bespectacled playwright Arthur Miller, the couple having been dubbed by the press 'the Egghead and the Hourglass’. But needy, insecure and unburdened by her marriage vows, Monroe turned for support during the film’s production to a young assistant on the set, Colin Clark, the brother of Alan Clark, later the famous Tory MP and  best-selling diarist. Thanks to Colin Clark’s caution —- something that his philandering brother would certainly not have showed in the same situation — the liaison with Monroe was unconsummated, never moving beyond a kiss. I will go to see the film, but only as a fan of period drama, not as a fan of Marilyn Monroe. I am one of the few straight men who does not worship at her altar. For I am exasperated rather than mesmerised by her breathy, childish voice and hysterically fluttering eyelashes. Her mix of phoney innocence and pushy voluptuousness holds little appeal for me. At times, with her fake blonde hair and exaggerated wiggle of her hips, she seems more like a grisly drag queen than a real woman. Yes, I recognise she has had a huge impact on our popular culture, but mainly in having helped spur the fashionable mood for victimhood, infantilism, vulgarity and self-absorption. The victim was the role she always played best, whether it be indulging in her regular threats of suicide as a means of emotional blackmail or in the long hours she spent in psychoanalysis, neurotically poring over her grievances. Yes, she is a role model, but largely for tiresome narcissists and exhibitionists. Nor do I think she was much of an actress. Despite a career lasting 14 years, she made no truly great films, gave no captivating performances. There was little depth to her. She almost always played the same shallow role, the ditsy helpless blonde craving masculine attention and protection. She had none of the impressive authority of other Hollywood actresses such as Barbara Stanwyck or Katharine Hepburn, who both excelled as strong women on screen. Monroe’s limited range was partly her own fault, for she was hopelessly unprofessional, especially in her later career. Constantly late on set, always eager for more retakes, she often failed to learn her lines and could become distraught at any criticism, no matter how constructive. The great director Otto Preminger said working with Marilyn was 'like directing Lassie'. Olivier was even more scathing: 'She is the stupidest, most self-indulgent tart I have ever come across.’' With typical sentimentality, Monroe claimed in her politics to be 'on the side of the workers’. Yet she did not show much appetite for hard work herself. On the production of her last film, Something’s Got To Give, she reported at the set just 12 times out of 35 days of shooting. Her irresponsible attitude caused directors, producers and colleagues endless frustration. Billy Wilder, who directed her in probably her most famous film, Some Like It Hot, once said that she 'should have gone to a train engineers’ school, then she might have learned something about arriving on schedule’. Monroe’s supporters try to excuse her by highlighting all the problems she endured. She was a victim, they say, not only of a troubled childhood, but also of a bullying studio system which pigeonholed her for the dumb blonde parts when she was capable of so much more. But this defence does not add up. It is true she had a tough upbringing. As the daughter of a mentally ill mother, she was raised in a series of foster homes and claimed to have been abused as a child. But millions of people have difficult backgrounds and triumph over them. Instead of overcoming obstacles, Monroe spent much of her life wallowing in them. In the process, she became one of the catalysts of the modern cult of victimhood, where individuals use a narrative of personal suffering to avoid taking responsibility for their own lives. It is telling that some of the worst modern airhead celebrities, such as Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan, identify so strongly with Marilyn. Indeed, when Lohan was facing yet another court case over her drug-taking, she wrote a long-winded essay on how she saw so much of herself in Monroe. 'Marilyn said she had no foundation. But she was really working on it. I’ve been trying to do the same thing,’' Ms Lohan wrote. But what is most offensive about Marilyn’s victimhood is that it was so phoney. This was a woman who, in the mid-1950s, was adored by millions. The idea that she was oppressed by the Hollywood studio system is just another piece of myth-making. In fact, in 1955, 20th Century Fox offered her a fabulous contract that required her to make only four films over the next seven years, while her own company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, was to be given a share of the profits for each film. In addition, she was allowed to work for other studios and could reject any director she didn’t like. Moreover, for all their frustrations, directors often showed great tolerance towards her. In the production of Niagara, her first big film, Henry Hathaway spent hours coaxing and comforting her as she prepared her scenes. Far from being the innocent victim of legend, Monroe was capricious, wilful and self-centred. She moaned about being a star, but was ferociously ambitious in her pursuit of fame. She ruthlessly dumped her first husband, Jim Dougherty, whom she married at 16, because she feared he might hold back her career. She claimed to be 'just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love’, yet she proceeded to alienate her husbands, including Arthur Miller and the baseball hero Joe DiMaggio, with her promiscuity, exhibitionism and neuroses. She didn’t respect any boundaries, as proved by her infamous performance, complete with an ultra-tight dress and breathiest possible voice, in singing 'Happy Birthday, Mr President’ to her sometime lover John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden in 1962. Quite rightly, the First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, a woman of infinitely greater dignity, was outraged at this public humiliation and threatened her husband with divorce. Monroe also wailed about being a sex symbol, but did all she could to encourage such an image, with her endless pouting and figure-hugging fashions. In one of her last acts before her death in 1962, she agreed to appear nude in Life magazine, so that she would 'push Liz Taylor off the covers’, to use her own jealous words'. For all her fame, Monroe became something of a bore because of her obsessive introspection, combined with drugs and alcohol. Even her psychiatrist, Dr Ralph Greenson, became exhausted by her —- so he gave her a tape recorder so she could endlessly replay her thoughts instead of spending hours talking to him. Given her emotional state, which since her teenage years had been characterised by threats of suicide, her end was predictable. She almost certainly died from a drugs overdose, though that has not stopped a deluge of wild conspiracy theories —- including that she was killed on the orders of the Kennedy brothers. All this speculation, unencumbered by hard evidence, has only fed the Monroe cult of victimhood. In this, her life and death has a parallel in Britain's own Princess Diana, another self-indulgent blonde who loved to play the victim despite her privileged status and wealth. Like Marilyn, she was fond of histrionic antics to draw pitying attention to herself. Like Marilyn, she craved media attention, yet bleated about it. As with Marilyn, her favourite subject of conversation was herself. And like Marilyn, she died young, leaving a trail of emotional wreckage behind her. Monroe once justified her quixotic behaviour with the line: 'It is better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring.' In my view, she ended up being both.
