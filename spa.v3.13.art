Molester Jackson|[1]|Prior to his death, Jackson faced allegations of child molestation in 1993 and 2003. In 1995, Jackson reached a $23 million settlement with the family of Jordan Chandler, and was acquitted by a California jury on charges of alleged abuse of a 13-year-old boy in 2005. He denied ever acting inappropriately with children throughout his life. In their first television interview prior to the airing of "Leaving Neverland," Robson and Safechuck told "CBS This Morning" how their alleged abuse with Jackson began. Both detailed the methods Jackson allegedly used when they visited his Neverland ranch in California as children. "Within either the first or second night of Michael and I being alone at Neverland, the night started changing. One of the ways I remember it starting is, you know, Michael just sort of starting to touch my legs and touch my crotch over my pants ... It progressed to him performing oral sex on me, him showing me how to perform oral sex on him," Robson said. Safechuck, who nodded his head as Robson spoke, said his alleged abuse began similarly. "He introduced me to masturbation ... he said I taught him how to French kiss ... and then it moves onto oral sex," Safechuck said. When Chandler and his family came forward alleging abuse in 1993, both Robson and Safechuck denied they had been molested. In 2005, when Jackson faced criminal charges, Robson defended Jackson, taking the stand and offering testimony in the singer's defense. "The training â€” Michael's training of me to testify began the first night that he started abusing me," Robson said. "He started telling me that if anybody else ever finds out, we'll both go to jail, both of our lives would be over." Both men eventually came forward with their own stories of Jackson's alleged abuse, filing individual lawsuits against his estate several years after his death. Those suits were dismissed for having been filed too late. Robson and Safechuck are both appealing those dismissals.
